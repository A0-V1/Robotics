# Background
In today's rapidly advancing field of robotics, there is a 
growing need for robust systems that can tackle various 
challenges. This research aims to address the challenges in 
design Sumo robotics competitions by developing an 
Arduino-based 2WD Sumo Tankbot. This study asserts that 
through the utilization of this robot, equipped with a scraper 
and controlled wirelessly via an Android mobile application, 
an agile and robust robotic platform can be achieved, capable 
of executing precise movements and strategies in Sumo 
battles.
