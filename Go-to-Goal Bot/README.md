# Project Description

Go-to-goal robots employ sensors like cameras, lidar, or sonar to sense their 
environment and pinpoint where they are in relation to it. Then, they navigate toward their 
target using algorithms like path planning and obstacle avoidance. Some goal-directed 
robots can also learn from their surroundings and modify their behavior over time to 
perform better. 
In this project, the sensors used are the ultrasonic sensors and the speed sensors. 
Particularly, the ultrasonic sensors sense the environment where the robot is placed, and 
the speed sensor counts the number of ticks to determine how far the robot has travelled. 
The robot is programmed though the Arduino Microcontroller.
